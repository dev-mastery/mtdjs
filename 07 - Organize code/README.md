## Key Takeaways

Source code should be in a separate folder from configuration files like `package.json`

Keeping our .spec file next to the code it's testing makes it easy to find and also helps us recognize immediately when a .spec is missing.

Instead of running Jest manually all the time, we can enable watch mode by adding the --watchAll flag to our test script.
